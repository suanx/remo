//! Server and store boundary contracts for Remo.
//!
//! This crate names the server-facing contract surface. It owns the
//! server/store scope boundary types and scoped store wrappers, and it
//! deliberately re-exports the full runtime vocabulary so that server/store
//! code can import everything it needs from a single crate. The re-export is a
//! superset, not a firewall: a consumer cannot tell from the import path alone
//! whether a type is server-only or shared with the runtime. That ergonomic
//! trade-off is intentional — narrowing it would force every server/store
//! crate to depend on both contracts and split its imports.
