//! Compile-tests for Remo documentation code examples.
//!
//! ## How this works
//!
//! Each `examples/*.rs` file under this crate is a self-contained smoke test
//! for one public API surface that user docs reference. CI runs both
//! `cargo build --examples -p remo-doctest` AND
//! `cargo test --locked -p remo-doctest --examples` — the test invocation
//! both compiles and runs each `main` fn (constructs the spec types and
//! exits zero). Either a rename / signature change OR a runtime panic in
//! the constructed shape fails CI before the docs go stale.
//!
//! Adding coverage: drop a new `examples/<surface>.rs`. Keep it minimal
//! (no live LLM calls, no network) and exercise only the trait / struct
//! shape — `Box::new(...)` or `let _ = SpecStruct { ... }` is enough to
//! pin the contract.
//!
//! ## History
//!
//! Previously this crate used `doc_comment::doctest!` to compile-test
//! every `rust` fence in `docs/book/src/**/*.md` (mdBook source). The
//! Starlight docs migration stripped `rust,ignore` modifiers for Shiki
//! compatibility, which flipped ~170 display-only snippets into compiled
//! doctests — most of them pseudocode that never compiled standalone.
//! The macro was retired in favour of the explicit `examples/` approach.
