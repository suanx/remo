//! Plumbing for invoking a sub-agent run from inside a tool.
//!
//! [`run_child_agent`] is the single canonical entry point for spawning a
//! child agent run. It routes delegate execution through the resolved backend
//! ([`ExecutionBackend`](crate::backend::ExecutionBackend)), so local and
//! remote (A2A) children share one call shape, and returns the full
//! [`BackendRunResult`] so the calling tool can decode child output,
//! propagate suspensions, or read the child's final persisted state.
//!
//! State exchange between parent and child is the caller's responsibility:
//! - **Inbound**: build a [`PersistedState`] from parent state + tool args
//!   and pass via `initial_state_seed`.
//! - **Outbound**: read `BackendRunResult.state` after the call, then publish
//!   to parent state via `ToolOutput.command`.
//!
//! Backend capabilities still apply, but parent → child state seeding is a
//! local-execution rule rather than a `BackendProfile` dimension. The
//! in-process Local backend applies the seed before the child's first step.
//! A2A and custom remote backends have no agreed seed-passing wire protocol;
//! `run_child_agent` rejects seeded delegate requests against non-local
//! execution plans rather than silently dropping the seed. If you need to ship
//! data to a remote child, encode it into the prompt yourself.
//!
//! For tools that want to stream the child's tokens into their own output,
//! wrap the activity sink with [`StreamingPassthroughSink`].
