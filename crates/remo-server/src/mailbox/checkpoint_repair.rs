//! In-process retry of checkpoint events that failed to publish after a freeze
//! commit. The freeze transaction is already durable; the canonical/outbox
//! checkpoint events are advisory projections published on a separate path.
//! Rather than waiting for the next process restart (startup
//! `repair_thread_message_checkpoint_events`), a failed publish is queued here
//! and retried on each maintenance sweep. Re-publishing is idempotent — the same
//! invariant startup repair already relies on — so a dropped or retried task
//! cannot duplicate events downstream.
